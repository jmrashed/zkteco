This Laravel package provides convenient functions for interacting with ZKTeco devices, allowing seamless communication with attendance devices (such as fingerprint, face recognition, or RFID) using UDP protocol. It simplifies the process of reading and writing data directly to these devices from a web server without the need for additional programs.

With this package, you can easily perform various activities with ZKTeco devices, such as retrieving attendance logs, setting user data, enabling or disabling device functions, and more, all within your Laravel application.

Designed as a class-based library, you can simply create an object of the provided class and utilize its functions to interact with ZKTeco devices effortlessly.

Key features include:

- Reading and writing data to attendance devices using UDP protocol.
- Seamless communication between web servers and attendance devices.
- Simplified implementation for activities such as retrieving attendance logs, setting user data, and managing device functions.
- Integration with Laravel framework for easy usage and compatibility.


Experience streamlined communication and management of ZKTeco devices directly from your Laravel application with this ZKTeco Laravel package.

 

The `jmrashed/zkteco` package provides easy to use functions to ZKTeco Device activities.

## Prerequisites

- PHP installed on your system
- Access to the `Jmrashed\Zkteco\Lib\ZKTeco` class
- Knowledge of the ZKTeco device IP address and port (if different from the default)

## Installation

To use the ZKTeco library, you need to include it in your PHP project. You can install it via Composer:
```bash
composer require jmrashed/zkteco
```

## Enabling PHP Sockets

This guide outlines the steps to enable PHP sockets on your server. Sockets are essential for establishing communication channels between different processes or computers over a network.

### Prerequisites

- PHP installed on your server
- Access to the `php.ini` configuration file
- Basic knowledge of server administration

### Steps

1. **Check PHP Installation**: Verify that PHP is installed on your server by running `php -v` in your terminal or command prompt.

2. **Enable Sockets Extension**: Edit the `php.ini` file to enable the sockets extension. Find the following line:

```ini
;extension=sockets
```

Remove the semicolon at the beginning of the line to uncomment it:

```ini
    extension=sockets
```

3. **Restart Web Server**: After editing `php.ini`, restart your web server to apply the changes. Use the appropriate command based on your server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx).

4. **Verify Installation**: Create a PHP file (e.g., `test.php`) with the following contents:

    ```php
    <?php
    if (function_exists('socket_create')) {
        echo "Sockets extension is enabled.";
    } else {
        echo "Sockets extension is not enabled.";
    }
    ```

    Access this file through your web browser to verify that the sockets extension is enabled.

5. **Firewall Configuration (if necessary)**: If you're using a firewall, ensure it allows connections on the socket port (default: 80).

6. **Test Socket Communication**: Implement socket communication logic in your PHP scripts to test the functionality. See the provided PHP example for creating a socket connection.

### Example Usage

Include the steps outlined in this guide in your server setup documentation to ensure proper configuration and enable PHP sockets for your applications.



## Usage of ZKTeco

1. The provided PHP code snippet seems to demonstrate the usage of the ZKTeco library, specifically for interacting with ZKTeco devices, likely for biometric attendance or access control systems. Let's elaborate on the code:

-   **Importing the ZKTeco Library:**
```php
use Jmrashed\Zkteco\Lib\ZKTeco;
```
This line imports the ZKTeco class from the Jmrashed\Zkteco\Lib namespace. This class likely contains the functionality to communicate with ZKTeco devices.
-   **Instantiating the ZKTeco Object::**
```php
$zk = new ZKTeco('192.168.1.201');
```
Here, an instance of the `ZKTeco` class is created with the IP address `192.168.1.201`. This likely establishes a connection to the `ZKTeco` device at that IP address. Optionally, you can specify the port number as the second parameter if it's different from the default port `4370`.

-   **Alternative Instantiation with Port::**
```php
// Using IP address and port
$zk = new ZKTeco('192.168.1.201', 8080);
```
This is an alternative way to instantiate the `ZKTeco` object, where both the IP address (`192.168.1.201`) and port number (`8080`) are provided explicitly.
